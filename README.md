# Rock and Mine Prediction
# Classification Project - Rock vs Mine

This project aims to classify rocks and mines using supervised learning techniques. The dataset is read using the pandas library, and the sklearn library is utilized for implementing the logistic regression model. 

The main objective is to train a model that can accurately classify whether an object is a rock or a mine based on certain features. The features are extracted from sonar signals, and the dataset consists of labeled examples of rocks and mines.

By utilizing the logistic regression algorithm, we can build a predictive model that learns from the provided data and makes predictions on unseen instances. The accuracy of the model can be evaluated using various performance metrics.

To run this project, make sure you have pandas and sklearn libraries installed in your Python environment. Execute the code in your preferred IDE or Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions on new data.
